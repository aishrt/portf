                        Suman Lata is a seasoned People Development Coach, who believes deeply in <strong>
                            people—people
                        </strong>, because people have the power to break you or make you. She strongly
                        believes that
                        individuals are the true strength. She believes that every individual has a unique personality
                        that can be developed positively through the right coaching and self-discovery at the right
                        time.

                        transformation, leadership hiring, and leadership development. Backed by a strong academic
                        foundation with dual master’s degrees in human resource management (MHRM) and Computer
                        Applications (MCA), she brings a rare blend of strategic thinking, human insight, and practical
                        execution to her coaching practice. She has personally coached and mentored more than 2,000
                        professionals and promoters, enabling them to gain clarity, confidence, and purposeful direction
                        in their careers, businesses, and lives. Her structured, stage-wise coaching methodology focuses
                        on deep self-discovery by guiding individuals through powerful reflective questions—What? Why?
                        and How?—that lead to sustainable behavioral and mindset shifts.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                        Guided by this philosophy, she has expanded her mission beyond professionals and promoters to
                        also coach students in schools, colleges, and universities, believing that when young minds are
                        guided early, it plays a vital role in shaping strong individuals and contributing to
                        nation-building. Her sessions for students are designed to help them understand themselves and
                        express their thoughts clearly. She guides them through self-discovery and building
                        self-confidence, teaching them to handle the questions, emotions, and pressures of
                        adolescence—from peers, family, and teachers, as well as their own self-imposed pressures.
                        Ultimately, her sessions empower students to understand themselves, distinguish right from
                        wrong, make wise decisions, and build a strong foundation for a successful future.
